// FILE:        vhcl_public.h
//      This file contains system level utilities and definitions.
//      This file should be included at the top of header files that will be used
//      publicly.  For example, in library headers.
//
//      Please avoid including other vhcl headers in public header files because
//      there may be unintended side-effects.  For example, vhcl_win32.h ignores
//      certain compiler warnings, or vhcl_assert.h re-defines ASSERT().  This
//      may not be acceptable in other projects that wish to use these libraries.
