ACTIVEMQ server setup:
add the following transport connector to the activemq configuration:

<transportConnector uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>

in the section:

<transportConnectors>
	<transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616"/>
	<transportConnector uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>
</transportConnectors>

How to load:
this package has a ASD definition file and can be loaded using the
ASDF package management system. http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/
Just make sure that you add to the ASDF path the location of the required
libraries (in the lib sub-directory).

Otherwise you can load it by loading the file load.lisp.
if you already have some of the required libraries (in the subdir lib)
then make sure to add the location of those libraries to the asdf path
so they are loaded insted of the provided ones (paths specified
in the load.lisp file).

How to use:
first call (connect) by default it connects to localhost:61613.
If you need to change host or port use the keyword arguments :host
and :port.

then call (attach-listener prefix listener) to redirect all incoming
messages matching the prefix (a string, if nil all messages will be
sent to the listener) to the listener. The listener is a function
of one argument, the received message.
See the provided function sample-listener for an example of a listener.
If you want to be able to selectively detach some listener, provide
a unique string identifier for each call to the attach-listener function.
For example: (attach-listener "test" #'sample-listener :id "test-id")
will register the function sample-listener to receive only messages with
prefix "test" and it'll be register with id "test-id". This listener
can then be removed calling (detach-listener "test-id").

call (stop) when you need to close the connection to the activemq server.

to send a message use (post prefix message) where prefix and message
are two strings.
