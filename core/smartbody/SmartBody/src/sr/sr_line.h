    \brief Three dimensional line

    SrLine defines a line by keeping two points in the three dimensional
    space. These two points are p1 and p2 of type SrVec(==SrPnt). When the line
    is considered as a segement, p1 and p2 will delimit the segment, and
    when the line is considered as a ray, the source of the ray is p1 and
    the ray direction is defined as p2-p1. */

        In this way, u and v indicate a parametric distance from the vertices
