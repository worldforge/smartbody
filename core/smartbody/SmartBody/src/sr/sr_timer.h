    \brief Measure time and execution per second rates.

    SrTimer is intended to help counting the time taken by any function or
    portion of code. It can also be used to measure the frames per second 
    rate of an application. After instantiation, the user should call start()
    just before the function to measure the time, and stop() right after. Then,
    the method dt() will return the elapsed time between both function calls.
    Many other time measurements are possible. It is considered that each time
    the start/end pair is called, one measurement is done. In this way the user
    can perform several measurements (like in a loop) and then retrieve the 
    meandt(), calculated according to the specified interval(). Times between
    measurements can also be retrieved with loopdt(). */
