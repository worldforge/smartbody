    SrLight Keeps light parameters following the OpenGL specifications.
    Note however that this class only stores data and has no dependency on
    OpenGL functions. */

        spot exponent is 0, resulting in uniform light distribution. Values must

        direction is transformed by the inverse of the modelview matrix when 
        glLight is called (just as if it was a normal), and it is stored in 
        eye coordinates. It is significant only when GL_SPOT_CUTOFF is not

        being lighted is greater than the spot cutoff angle, then the light 
        is completely masked. Otherwise, its intensity is controlled by the 
        spot exponent and the attenuation factors. The default spot cutoff

        the vertex being lighted, and the quadratic factor multiplied by 
        the square of the same distance. The default attenuation factors
        are cte=1, linear=0, quad=0, resulting in no attenuation. Only
