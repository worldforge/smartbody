    \brief Resizable dynamic string

    SrString keeps a dynamic allocated buffer containing a string. This 
    buffer can have a capacity greater than the current string being stored,
    to speedup some string operations. Whenever some string operation results
    with a string with bigger size than the capacity of the original string,
    the buffer is reallocated. But when the result is smaller, no reallocation
    is done. The method compress() can be used to free the extra internal
    buffer space. Important: when the string is empty, its buffer will point
    to a static empty string (""), so that SrString will always contain a 
    valid string when accessing its internal buffer pointer with the type cast
    operator (const char*). With this type cast defined, all functions having
    a const char* parameter can receive a SrString parameter. */
