/**
* \brief The skeleton animation breathing controller
*
* This controller implements the breathing interface - MeCtBreathingInterface - 
* using skeleton animation. Precisely, uses animations which tend to rely
* spine1-spine5 (mostly spine1-spine3) to simulate breathing.
*
* SBM commands:
* Sintax: breathing <controller_name> <options>
* Options:
*  help
*		Shows this information.
*  bpm <value> [isSmooth]   
*		Sets the breaths-per-minute rate. 
*		Set 'isSmooth' to 'true' or 'false' to define whether to apply a 
*		smooth transition. Defaults to 'true'.
*  min <value> [transition]    
*		Sets the minimum respiratory volume. Use with the linear and sine 
*		breath cycles only. 
*		Set 'transition' to the transition duration in seconds. Default 
*		value is 1.0s.
*  max <value> [transition]    
*		Sets the maximum respiratory volume. Use with the linear and sine 
*		breath cycles only. 
*		Set 'transition' to the transition duration in seconds. Default 
*		value is 1.0s.
*  motion <name>
*		Sets the breathing motion.
*  incremental <bool> 
*		Sets whether the breathing motion is additive.
*  push linear
*		Pushes to the top of the stack the (default) linear breathing cycle.
*  push sine
*		Pushes to the top of the stack a sine breathing cycle.
*  push keyframe <time1> <value1> <time2> <value2> ...
*		Pushes to the top of the stack a custom keyframe breathing cycle.
*  push spline knot1_x knot1_y knot2_x knot2_y ...
*		Pushes to the top of the stack a spline breathing cycle.
*  pop
*		Pops the breathing cycle from the top of the stack. 
*  print  
*		Prints the controller's state
*
* SBM sequence file: test-breathing.seq
