/*********************************READ ME********************************************************************************
* The Lilt controller Attempts to make a controller that allows the doctor to stand on his tiptoes at a certain magnitude for
a given duration as done by some people in the midst of conversation when making a point -- it can ideally be used when the doctor is 
emphasizing something. Note that the doctor body has to be translated to get the effect of moving upward.
I did not research if Iraqi people would actually do this- it was more to learn how to make a 
controller. Furthermore there are a few wierd issues dealing with BP-Neutral- mainly the ankles aren't at 0 angle and 
the left and right ankle are rotated a different amount leading to a an awkward ankle rotation to get the doctor 
back to the bp-neutral stance.


USE: launch SBM and at the SBM command line implement the following commads
   ctrl <> lilt <char-name>
    snod <> <dur-sec> <mag-deg>
    char <> ctrl <> begin [<ease-in> [<ease-out>]]
EXAMPLE: for example if I wanted the doctor's ankles to go to a 50 degree angle and the whole lilt to last 3 seconds I would do the 
			following

			ctrl Y lilt doctor
			lilt Y 3.0 50
			char doctor ctrl Y begin 0.3 0.3
