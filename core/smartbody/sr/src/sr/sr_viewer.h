    \brief A  viewer

    SrViewer implements a viewer to render objects derived from SrSn.
    The viewer has currently a planar and a tridimensional examiner mode.
    In ModePlanar, only transformation on the XY plane are accepted.
    In all modes, mouse interaction is done together with Ctrl and Shift modifiers.
    A popup menu appears with a right button click or ctrl+shift+m. */
