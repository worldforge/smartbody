    \brief Fast resizeable array base class

    This class is to be derived, and not to be directly used. See SrArray for
    a user-ready class. All memory management functions of SrArrayBase were
    written using quick memory block functions. In this way, malloc() and free()
    functions are used. So that void pointers are used to refer to user's data.
    Most methods need to know the size of each element that is the parameter 
    sizeofx appearing several times. */

    \brief Fast resizeable dynamic array

    All memory management functions of SrArray use quick memory block functions 
    and so be aware that constructors and destructors of class X are not called. 
    SrArray can be used only with classes or structs that do not have any internal
    allocated data, as SrArray will not respect them when resizing. Internally, 
    malloc(), realloc() and free() functions are used throught SrArrayBase methods. 
    Note that the array size is automatically reallocated when needed (with a double
    size strategey), and so take care to not reference internal memory of SrArray
    that can be reallocated. For example, the following code is wrong: a.push()=a[x],
    because a[x] referentiates a memory space that can be reallocated by push() */
