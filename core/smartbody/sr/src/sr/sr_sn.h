/*! \class SrSn sr_sn.h
    \brief scene node base class

    Defines a base class for all scene nodes, which might be of
    four types: group, editor, matrix, or shape.
    1. It cannot be directly instantiated by the user, and so there is not 
       a public constructor available.
    2. The scene graph was designed to be simple and small. There are only
       few basic nodes defined in the sr library.
    3. A scene node does not have any information about its parent in the
       scene graph, and node sharing is supported. A reference counter is
       used for automatically deleting unused nodes, see ref() and unref()
       methods in the parent class SrSharedClass. */
