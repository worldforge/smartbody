/*! \class SrHashTableBase sr_hash_table.h
    Stores user data associated with string keys in a hash table. 
    Note1: this is a rather specific implementation: colliding elements 
    are appended to the same array of entries, this is very efficient for inserting
    elements but less practical for removing elements (removal was not implemented).
    Note2: the user is responsible for allocation/deallocation of the appended user data,
    which is merely stored as given void pointers, more info about that in the SrHashTable class. */
